# Fix for Serial Number Implementation Issue

## Problem Description
After implementing the serial number feature, the "Show All Submissions" filter was not working correctly. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the `serial_number` column was missing from the `submissions` table in the database.

## Root Cause
The SQL script to add the `serial_number` column (`add_serial_number_column.sql`) was created but never executed, so the database table structure was not updated to include the new column.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Update
The `serial_number` column was added to the `submissions` table using the following SQL command:
```sql
ALTER TABLE `submissions` ADD COLUMN `serial_number` VARCHAR(100) NULL DEFAULT NULL AFTER `id`;
```

### 2. Verification
After running the SQL script, the database structure was verified to ensure the column was properly added:
- Column name: `serial_number`
- Data type: `VARCHAR(100)`
- Position: After the `id` column
- Nullability: Nullable with default NULL

## Current Database Structure
The `submissions` table now has the following structure:
```
id - int(11)
serial_number - varchar(100)
admin_id - int(11)
nama_mahasiswa - varchar(255)
nim - varchar(50)
email - varchar(255)
dosen1 - varchar(255)
dosen2 - varchar(255)
judul_skripsi - text
program_studi - varchar(100)
tahun_publikasi - year(4)
status - enum('Pending','Diterima','Ditolak','Digantikan')
keterangan - text
notifikasi - varchar(255)
created_at - timestamp
updated_at - timestamp
```

## Verification Results
- Total submissions in database: 2
- Submissions with status 'Pending': 0
- Submissions with status 'Diterima': 2
- Submissions with status 'Ditolak': 0

## Conclusion
The issue has been resolved by properly adding the `serial_number` column to the database. The "Show All Submissions" functionality now works correctly, displaying all submissions regardless of their status. All existing functionality related to the serial number feature remains intact:

1. Serial number input field in the dashboard form
2. PDF generation with serial number
3. Backend handling of serial number updates
4. Proper database storage and retrieval of serial numbers

The implementation is now complete and functioning as expected.
