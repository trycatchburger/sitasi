# File Upload Security Improvements

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the file upload security improvements as outlined in the IMPROVEMENT_TASKS.md file, section 1.2 "File Upload Security".

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced ValidationService

The `app/Models/ValidationService.php` file was enhanced with the following new methods:

- `validateFileContent()`: Validates file content by checking the actual MIME type using the finfo extension
- `sanitizeFileName()`: Sanitizes file names to prevent directory traversal attacks
- `getMaxFileSize()`: Returns the maximum allowed file size
- `getAllowedMimeTypes()`: Returns the allowed MIME types
- `scanFileForVirus()`: Placeholder method for antivirus scanning that can be extended with actual antivirus services

Configuration was also added to set:
- Maximum file size: 10MB (10240KB)
- Allowed file types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT

### 2. Updated Submission Model

The `app/Models/Submission.php` file was updated to:

- Include the ValidationService dependency
- Enhance the `handleFileUploads()` method with comprehensive security checks:
  - File name sanitization
  - File size validation
  - File content validation (MIME type checking)
  - File type whitelisting
  - Antivirus scanning (placeholder implementation)
  - Prevention of file overwrites

### 3. Test Scripts

Two test scripts were created:
- `test_file_upload_security.php`: Comprehensive test of all security features
- `debug_file_validation.php`: Debug script to verify MIME type detection

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. File Content Validation
- Files are validated by their actual MIME type, not just extension
- Prevents uploading files with mismatched extensions (e.g., text files with .pdf extension)

### 2. Antivirus Scanning
- Placeholder implementation that can be extended with actual antivirus services
- Examples provided for ClamAV and VirusTotal API integration

### 3. Configurable File Size Limits
- Maximum file size set to 10MB
- Easily configurable in the ValidationService configuration

### 4. File Type Whitelisting
- Only allows PDF, DOC, DOCX, and TXT files
- Easily extensible for additional file types

### 5. File Name Sanitization
- Removes path information to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Removes special characters that could be used maliciously
- Limits file name length to 255 characters

## Testing Results

All security features have been tested and verified:

1. File name sanitization correctly handles directory traversal attempts
2. File content validation correctly identifies mismatched file extensions
3. File size limits are properly enforced
4. File type whitelisting restricts uploads to allowed types
5. Antivirus scanning placeholder is implemented and ready for extension

## Integration Notes

To implement actual antivirus scanning, you would need to:

1. Choose an antivirus service (ClamAV, VirusTotal, etc.)
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Uncomment and modify the relevant sections in the `scanFileForVirus()` method
4. Add any required API keys or configuration

For example, to integrate with ClamAV:
```php
// In the scanFileForVirus method:
if (class_exists('Clamav')) {
    try {
        $clamav = new Clamav();
        $result = $clamav->scan($filePath);
        return $result === Clamav::RESULT_OK;
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        throw new Exception("Virus scan failed: " . $e->getMessage());
    }
}
```

## Files Modified

1. `app/Models/ValidationService.php` - Enhanced with new security methods
2. `app/Models/Submission.php` - Updated file upload handling with security checks
3. `test_file_upload_security.php` - Test script (new file)
4. `debug_file_validation.php` - Debug script (new file)

## Verification

Run `php test_file_upload_security.php` to verify all security features are working correctly.
